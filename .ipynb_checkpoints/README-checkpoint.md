      Title

Maximizing Profit in Retail Banking through Derivative-Based Optimization Techniques

Focus: Maximize bank profit (e.g., net interest income)

Sector: Retail banking

Method: Calculus (derivatives) for optimization

      Objectives

Maximize net interest income (NII) in retail banking.

Formulate a derivative-based mathematical model for optimal loan interest rates or allocation.

Analyze sensitivity of profit/NII with respect to interest rates and default probabilities.

Provide a decision-making framework for banking strategies.

      Apparatus Required

Software/Tools: Python (Jupyter Notebook), Excel

Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SymPy

Data: Simulated banking data (loan amounts, interest rates, default probabilities)

Mathematical Tools: Calculus (derivatives), optimization techniques

| Limited understanding of NII sensitivity    | Hard to balance risk and return      | Sensitivity analysis on interest rates and default probabilities    |

      Problem Statement

Retail banks aim to maximize profit from lending, but interest rates and default risks affect net interest income. This project develops a derivative-based optimization model to determine the interest rates and loan allocations that maximize NII, providing actionable insights for banking decision-making.

Define Variables:

​𝐿𝑖 = Loan amount for customer i
​𝑟𝑖 = Interest rate for customer i
​𝑑𝑖(𝑟𝑖) = Probability of default (depends on interest rate)
